# variables/

Every copy fill-in, one map per surface (copy, email, image, video).

---

## {{brand}} — variables

**One map per brand, per surface.** A machine reads ONLY its own surface's
map — copy never loads email's variables, video never loads copy's. Nothing
brand-specific lives in any machine; the workflow reads this file at run time
for whatever brand it is pointed at.

**A run declares an avatar.** Everything avatar-shaped resolves through it,
and there is no default: a run that does not declare one is writing to nobody.

The four surface maps every brand carries. Fill the paths as the brand's
files land; a machine that finds no map falls back to the conventional
layout and says so.
