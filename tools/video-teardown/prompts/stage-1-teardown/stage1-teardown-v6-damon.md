Take this individual video and break it down completely so I can
reverse-engineer it. Break down the scenes, the script, the characters, and
what the characters are doing and how they're doing it — each and every
element individually, timestamped, scene by scene. Go deep. A long,
heavily detailed output is what I want — do not compress or summarize.

You are building a reproduction spec: someone who has never seen this video
must be able to re-create it — the person, the clothes, the room, the shots,
the words — from your teardown alone. If a detail would matter to someone
re-creating the video, it belongs in your output.

**Describe the subject in front of you, not a default.** Every example in
this prompt is illustrative only — an age bracket, a garment, a style
reference — and none of them describe the video you are looking at. Take
gender, age, register and aesthetic from what is actually on screen. Never
carry over the framing of a previous teardown, and never reach for the
category's stock subject. A record that describes someone other than the
person in the video is worthless no matter how detailed it is.

**This is observation, not evaluation.** You are recording what is
demonstrably there so it can be analysed later — not judging whether it is
good, not recommending anything, not writing about the brand. Record brand
names when they appear on products in frame, because that is a fact about
the video. Never editorialise about the brand, never assess the product, and
never describe the video as effective or ineffective outside the sections
that explicitly ask for mechanism. **Abstraction happens downstream; your job
is an accurate record.**

Three laws govern everything:

**Accuracy law.** Never guess. If you cannot see or hear something clearly,
write `[UNCLEAR at 0:12]` instead of a plausible guess. Mark anything you
inferred rather than directly observed with `(inferred)`. A confident wrong
detail is worse than a marked gap — wrong details get built into real
briefs.

**Consistency law.** Every element gets ONE name, used identically
everywhere it appears. Every detail cited anywhere in your output must
exist in the objective record. State the age range ONCE, in brackets
(e.g. `[50-55]`), and reuse that exact range everywhere.

**Depth law.** The record's detail demands must never thin the analysis.
Sections 2 and 3 go as deep as the record goes precise: every phase's
"Why it works" names the exact words, visual choice, or pacing doing the
work; every "What it sets up" names the specific next move it enables,
never a generic outcome. If length becomes a pressure, cut nothing —
write longer.

I need four things.

**1. THE OBJECTIVE RECORD**

Open with a Character & Setting profile:

- Who appears — age range in brackets, physical description, hair
  (color, style), makeup (be specific: what look, what products/effects
  are visible), and voice: accent or nationality cues if audible, energy,
  pace.
- Exactly what they are wearing — every garment with its color,
  material, pattern, trim, and fit ("red beaded dress" is not enough —
  what pattern do the beads make, what's the neckline, what's the
  outline). Every piece of jewelry: rings, bracelets, earrings, watches —
  and the brand if identifiable.
- Style label — name the aesthetic with a real reference point
  ("Dolce & Gabbana-style baroque," "athleisure") rather than a vague
  mood word. If it matches a known style, say which.
- The setting, as it actually is — what kind of space this really
  appears to be (judge from lighting, furniture age and color, finishes —
  don't upgrade an ordinary room into an "upscale" one). Then inventory
  the room: what is on the shelves, cabinets, walls — not just the focal
  props. The whole setting is the set.
- Props — every object that appears, with color/material detail.

Then give me one table with exactly these four columns, in this order:

`Timestamp | Visuals | On-Screen Text | Transcript`

- **Timestamp** — start and end, e.g. `0:00 - 0:11`
- **Visuals** — only what is in frame, at the same level of detail as the
  profile above: who is there, what they are doing, their facial
  expression and reaction, camera work for this row — shot type, camera
  angle, front-facing or rear camera, phone-grade or high-res — setting,
  props, and effects. Every effect or transition gets its shape, size,
  color, and a canonical name you reuse every time it recurs
  (`Transition-1: pink glowing heart, ~1/3 screen height`). No on-screen
  text in this column.
- **On-Screen Text** — every overlay and caption, word for word, in
  order, separated by `|`. Nothing else in this column. Write "none" if
  there is none. If a text element looks like an app or editor watermark
  rather than intentional content, mark it `[ARTIFACT: …]` — we must not
  copy junk into new videos.
- **Transcript** — exactly what is SPOKEN, word for word. The transcript
  is never the on-screen text — if they differ, the spoken words go here
  and the overlay stays in its own column. Label every line with its
  speaker (`Creator:`, `Doctor:`, name them if named) and, where it
  carries meaning, the tone (`[skeptical]`, `[excited]`). If there is no
  speech, describe the music or sound design in brackets — and if you can
  identify the actual track, name it. If speech is inaudible or garbled,
  mark `[UNCLEAR]` — never fill the gap with the overlay text or a guess.

One row per scene or per distinct visual change — a change of speaker,
camera setup, or on-screen text starts a NEW row; never merge adjacent
moments into one row, and never merge these columns.

**2. THE SCENE MECHANICS**

Break the video into its functional phases — the blocks of work, not the
individual rows. Name each phase for what it does to the viewer, not for
what is on screen (e.g. "Visual Destruction & Negative Bait Hook",
"Agitation / Problem Definition", "The Magic Mechanism", "Benefit Stacking
& Objection Handling", "Incentive Escalation", "Scarcity CTA").

Use ONE canonical name per technique: if the detailed analysis calls it
"the vulnerability hook," the phase-level view calls it the vulnerability
hook too — keep the high-level and detailed layers, but never two names
for one thing. Where a technique is an established term from psychology or
direct-response marketing, use the established term.

For every phase, give me all four of these as separate labeled lines:

- **Phase name and timestamp range**
- **Mechanical purpose** — one line: what this phase is engineered to do to
  the viewer.
- **Why it works** — the detail. Name the specific thing doing the work:
  the exact words, the visual choice, the pacing, the order. Name the
  technique it belongs to. Say what the viewer feels or concludes. Then
  end the line with the labeled clause `Breaks if cut:` followed by the
  specific thing that fails without this phase — every phase, no
  exceptions.
- **What it sets up** — the next phase this one makes possible.

Then two more sub-sections:

- **Script beats.** Every line that does real work gets its own entry —
  not a selected few, and a phase with three working lines gets three
  entries. Each entry is four labeled lines, in this order and no other
  shape:

  ```
  Line: "<the words, quoted exactly>"
  Device: <the named technique this line is performing>
  Why it lands: <why it works on the specific audience this video is
  aimed at — name who that is and what they already believe>
  Trigger words: <the individual words carrying the charge, listed>
  ```

  A one-line summary in place of the four is a failed entry. `Device` and
  `Trigger words` are never the same content: the device is what the line
  does, the trigger words are which words do it.
- **Pacing and rhythm.** How often it cuts, how long each phase runs, where
  the tempo shifts, and what each shift is buying.

**3. THE PSYCHOLOGY**

Use the same subsection structure every time, in this order — formats may
add extras at the end, but these six always appear with these names:

- **The thesis** — one line naming the whole psychological play, in quotes
  (e.g. "The Maverick Insider vs. The Stagnant Institution").
- **Character archetype** — who the presenter is being, using established
  archetype language (e.g. "the aspirational self," "the sage") rather
  than invented labels, and the specific signals that build it: wardrobe,
  styling, cadence, eye contact, props. Cite only details already in the
  objective record.
- **Aesthetic archetype** — what the look itself signals, and what it
  borrows credibility from.
- **The setting** — what the location does for believability.
- **The psychological plays** — numbered. Name each one — established
  terms referenced where they exist — then say how it is executed in this
  specific video. End every play with the labeled line `Belief shift:`
  naming what the viewer now believes (or no longer believes) because of
  this play — every play, no exceptions.
- **The viewer's end state** — what the viewer believes, feels, or fears at
  the end that they did not at 0:00.

**4. THE INDEX**

Close with two short registries:

- **Definitions index** — every named technique and play used above, one
  line each: the canonical name, a one-line definition, and whether it is
  an established term (say from where) or our working label.
- **Element registry** — every recurring visual element (transitions,
  effects, overlays) with its canonical name, shape, size, and color, and
  the timestamps where it appears.

Give me a really clean output. I'm going to turn this into a brief that
takes in my brand principles and then creates content for that.
