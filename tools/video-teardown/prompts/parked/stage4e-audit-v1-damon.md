The finished script: {full_script}

The replication spec: {replication_spec}
The placement plan: {placement_plan}

**This is the gate.** Judge the script against the source it came from and
the rules it must obey. Return a verdict and, if it fails, **name which
pass to re-run** — not a list of suggestions.

Be adversarial. A script that reads well and breaks the spine is the exact
failure this exists to catch, and it will always read well.

## THE SEVEN CHECKS

### 1 · Did the spine survive?

Compare against the teardown record beat by beat. **Every `[SOURCE]` beat
must still be in its original order, doing its original job.**

Fail if: beats were reordered, merged, split, or dropped · the device that
made the format work is gone · the opening was replaced rather than
upgraded.

→ **Re-run 4c.**

### 2 · Was the source compressed to make room?

The original section must be **whole**. Added runtime is added, not traded.

Fail if: source beats are shorter than in the record · the format's own
rhythm was sped up to fit the pitch.

→ **Re-run 4c.**

### 3 · Does the register hold across the turn?

Read the beats either side of the product placement. **The same person must
be speaking.**

Fail if: sentence length or vocabulary jumps at the turn · a behaviour
became a condition — she stops describing what she does and starts
describing what she has · the speaker starts sounding like a brand · the
creator's own quirks (dropped articles, no adjectives) disappear after the
turn.

→ **Re-run 4b if the hook is the mismatch, 4c if the body is.**

### 4 · Does the hook cite a real customer, and does the frame match it?

Fail if: the hook cannot be traced to a verbatim in the bank · the opening
image is about something other than the opening line · the hook asserts
something about the speaker that may not be true, unflagged.

→ **Re-run 4b.**

### 5 · Are the mechanics ours?

Fail if: any usage instruction belongs to the source's product rather than
ours · frequency, method or duration contradicts the brand material · a
demo is described that our product does not do.

→ **Re-run 4c. This is the most commonly missed check** — the script reads
fine either way, which is exactly why it slips through.

### 6 · Claims, offer and rules

Fail if: any never-pair rule is broken — fake urgency, countdown, fake
scarcity, subscription language, discount stacking · a dated result promise
appears · a banned word appears · the guarantee is paraphrased rather than
quoted · a price is stated that isn't confirmed, or without saying which
channel it is · a number appears that nothing substantiates.

→ **Re-run 4d.**

### 7 · Is anything invented?

Fail if: any figure, statistic, testimonial, person or fact appears that
cannot be traced to a supplied source. **An invented number is an automatic
fail regardless of how well the script reads.**

→ **Re-run whichever pass produced it.**

---

## THE RUNTIME SANITY CHECK

Two questions, both cheap:

1. **Cut the script at the product placement. Is what's left still worth
   posting on its own?** If not, the turn came too early and the camouflage
   is gone. → re-run 4a.
2. **Does the runtime match the rungs?** Under ~15 seconds an asset cannot
   carry more than problem-awareness. If it tries to reach an offer in
   thirteen seconds, the plan is wrong, not the writing. → re-run 4a.

---

## OUTPUT

**VERDICT** — one of:

- **SHIP** — all seven checks pass, slots are flagged not filled with
  inventions, and the runtime check holds.
- **RE-RUN** — followed by the specific passes to re-run and, for each, the
  one thing that must change. Be precise: "re-run 4c, the usage instruction
  at 0:40 belongs to the source's product" — not "improve the mechanics."
- **STOP** — the format cannot carry this. Say what the asset is good for
  instead. A format with no placement beat is a hook that hands off to
  another asset, and saying so is a correct answer, not a failure.

Then:

**CHECK TABLE** — all seven, pass or fail, with the evidence for any fail
quoted from the script.

**OPEN SLOTS** — everything still unfilled, and who has the fact.

**WHAT I WOULD WATCH** — the one thing most likely to be wrong that these
checks cannot catch. Say it plainly rather than padding the verdict.

---

**Two passes maximum before a human looks at it.** If the same check fails
twice, the problem is upstream — the placement plan, the brand material, or
the format itself — and another rewrite will not fix it. Say that instead
of trying a third time.
